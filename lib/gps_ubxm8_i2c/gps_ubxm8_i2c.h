/**
 * Class for interfacing over i2c with any M8 GPS.
 * Before this class is used, the GPS reset pin needs to be pulled high.
 *
 * This class keeps its own finite state machine for abstracting away polling data availability and retrying requests.
 * An example usage is as follows:
 * ```
  int main(void)
  {
      HAL_Init();

      SystemClock_Config();

      MX_GPIO_Init();

      MX_I2C1_Init();

      GPS gps(GPS_RST_GPIO_Port, GPS_RST_Pin, &hi2c1, PVT_MESSAGE);
      gps.Init();
      HAL_Delay(1000);

      int lastITOW = 0;
      while(1) {
          volatile GPS::PollResult res = gps.PollUpdate();
          auto state = gps.GetState();
          if(state == GPS::State::RESPONSE_READY) {
              UBX_NAV_PVT_PAYLOAD sol = *(UBX_NAV_PVT_PAYLOAD*)gps.GetSolution();
              volatile int diff = sol.iTOW - lastITOW;
              lastITOW = sol.iTOW;
              if((GPSFixType)sol.fixType == GPSFixType::FIX_3D) {
                  HAL_Delay(1000);
              }
              gps.Reset();
          } else {
              HAL_Delay(100);
          }
      }
  }
  ```
 *
 * After a packet is received, you _need_ to call the reset method.
 * If you don't, `pollUpdate` will just do nothing and return a `POLL_ALREADY_FINISHED` response.
 *
 * The datasheet is here:
 * https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/products/documents/u-blox8-M8_ReceiverDescrProtSpec_UBX-13003221.pdf
 * The most relevant parts are "UBX Protocol" (section 32) and "DDC Port" (section 15).
